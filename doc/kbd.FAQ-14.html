<!--

<P>The two keys PrintScrn/SysRq and Pause/Break are special in that they
have two keycodes: the former has keycode 84 when Alt is pressed
simultaneously, and keycode 99 otherwise; the latter has keycode
101 when Ctrl is pressed simultaneously, and keycode 119 otherwise.
(Thus, it makes no sense to bind functions to Alt keycode 99 or
Ctrl keycode 119.)
<P>If you have strange keys, that do not generate any code under Linux
(or generate messages like "unrecognized scancode"), and your kernel
is 1.1.63 or later, then you can use setkeycodes(1) to tell the kernel
about them. They won't work under X, however.
Once they have gotten a keycode from <CODE>setkeycodes</CODE>, they can be assigned
a function by <CODE>loadkeys</CODE>.
