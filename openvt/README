This directory is derived from Jon Tombs' sources for the program open
(with -u option added by Joshua Spoerri), as found in open-1.4.tar.gz

I fixed a few minor flaws, and renamed the program to openvt
in order to diminish namespace pollution.
The -vt suffix fits with chvt and deallocvt.

In open-1.4.tar.gz there was also a program switchto,
but since it is completely identical to chvt
(and slightly less robust), I removed it.
