This is kbd-0.98.tar.gz

This package contains keytable files and keyboard utilities compatible
with kernel version 1.1.54 and later. Setfont requires 1.1.92 or later.

This distribution contains no binaries - the sources depend on the
kernel version - compile them yourself.

To install this package, unpack it somewhere and issue the commands
"./configure", "make" and "make install".  This copies the utilities
to /usr/bin, man pages to /usr/man/man{1,4,5,8} and data files to the
subdirectories keymaps, consolefonts, consoletrans and videomodes of
the datadirectory chosen during configure, probably /usr/lib/kbd.

Older versions of kbd used /usr/lib/kbd/keytables (instead of .../keymaps).
This directory can now be removed. (Just to be sure, preserve a copy
of your favourite keymap, for example in /usr/lib/kbd/keymaps/mykeymap.
Note that it may be used from a script in /etc/rc.d/rc.local or so.)

Report problems with this package to Andries Brouwer <aeb@cwi.nl>.
